Begin Creating a new project with composer 5.5 LTS

# composer create-project laravel/laravel curso-styde "5.5.*"

Init git 

# git init

# git add .

# git commit -m "begining Project"

# git push origin master


1. Begining the project

Laravel uses Front Controller patron to avoid spaguetti code

Index.php

All request arrive to index.php in 
public/index.php


For this case we use Laravel Vallet to create code with magic

Vallet is available for Mac, Linux and Windows

in index.php

die($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

and in the browser

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Represent home o the page of my project

and we can use 
urls like

/contacto
/home
/portfolio

This for the mod mod_rewrite of Apache

thhe file htaccess

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
        Options -MultiViews -Indexes
    </IfModule>

    RewriteEngine On

    # Handle Authorization Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

    # Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
    RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]

    # Handle Front Controller...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]


</IfModule>

With NGnx resolve index.php


In the public directory the files of this directory will be public like css, js

files of PHP the routes files, vendor files will we private.



3. Re capituling

All request from user will be procesed for this file index.php

Here Laravel will be init the aolicacion, we generally does. But in some case Laravel will ask, now what can i do with the request user.

a Form to explanin to Laravel what ca it do with each request Laravel uses
routes folder

/routes  

Here we can manage the routes

<?php

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Web Routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you can register web routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| contains the "web" middleware group. Now create something great!
|
*/

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});


We use get to resolve the route for home and we resolve with a file called welcome in 

/resources/views/welcome.blade.php

Blade is the template system of Laravel.




4. We can change to other view and create another template from cero

Now if i try to call other page for example

http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacto

We obtain an error 404


Because this url doen't exist.
